# MyCodeQuiz

In this assignment I created a code quiz. In this timed quiz you are given 10 multiple-choice questions and 100 seconds to complete all of them. If you answer a question incorrectly you will be docked 10 seconds. If the timer runs out it is game over and you will be sent back to the start page. If you complete the quiz in the alotted time, you will be given the option to type in your initials and save your score. 

I created this quiz by pulling html elements into javascipt as variables, and then applying event listeners and functions to those elements to allow the user to navigate through the questions of the quiz.
